It's been a quiet week thanks, or no thanks, to the novel coronavirus.
In the depths of my mind, my fears ring alarms and warnings.
My thoughts drift to my family--especially my grandparents and parents--and to unknown elderly folk seen in my daily walks and runs.
No one should want our current state of affairs with its isolation and ineffectual anxiety.
Yet, there's a peaceful, strangely loving facade in the neighborhood: parents walking with their children, fathers and daughters jogging together, and smiles from pedestrian passersby patiently standing off the sidewalk to keep distance.
From this view, each delicate day unfolds languidly.
This facade is almost a painting to admire.
It suggests and imperfectly imitates an ideal in which society gives us space and respite to cherish what matters most.
I almost deceived myself into forgetting that I would be a subject in this painting analogy.
Like many of the subjects, this one lives in apprehension and wishes the world was otherwise.
