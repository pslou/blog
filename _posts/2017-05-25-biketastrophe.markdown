So I stopped at this redlight on my "new" bike and I noticed that although I
stopped, the front wheel was still rolling a little forward. Out of curiousity,
I picked up my bike by the handles to understand what had just happend. 
Lo and behold, it turns out my front wheel detached itself off the fork. Welp.
