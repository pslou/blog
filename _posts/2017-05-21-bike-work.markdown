So here are the photos. These are the tools and the new bike levers:

And these are the old bike handles:

The calipers you see below are centerpull brake calipers. 
My fingers were crying and my back was mad aching by the end
of servicing them. I had to take multiple tries adjusting the break cable
in the yolk and I inadvertently looped the rear break cable onto the nut for the 
seat height adjustment. So I can't actually adjust the seat height anymore...

This is what the bike looked like after I was done:

And I took it down a slope to test the breaks:

The breaks were weak but acceptable since I can use my feet to stop
myself after slowing down enough. So YAY!
