Winnie-the-Pooh had a "thoughtful spot" where he would sit on a log, close one
eye, and tap his head repeatedly as he said, "Think, think, think." 
In the spirit of Pooh, I named the blog "plou's tHoTFuL SPot". The traditional 
pronounciation of my last name, "Lou", is pronounced as the English word "Low", but 
I grew up having a good proportion individuals (including myself about 70% of the time)
pronouncing it as the "Lou" in "Mary Lou"
or "Skip to My Lou". Assuming the latter pronounciation, "plou" sounds quite
similar to "Pooh". And much like Pooh, I was a very happy, unassuming, and chubby child
growing up (I don't believe I could be properly categorized as fat after looking 
how thin my legs were in my childhood photos).

There is something universally endearing about the characters who inhabit the
Hundred Acres Wood. Randy Pausch emphasized our conscious choice to be like
Eeyore or Tigger, to wallow in our sorrow or to approach life with a tenacious
joy. Benjamin Hoff related the Taoist idea of the uncarved block, "P'u", to the
character Pooh, attributing to Pooh a simple-minded, but not stupid, awareness 
of the present moment. Of course, this blog is not about the world of
Winnie-the-Pooh, nor is it about anything specific really. But Pooh
and my other old friends from the Hundred Acres Wood remind me each and every
day to retain a childlike heart; I hope this blog is an outward expression of
a simple curiousity and joy.
