Winnie-the-Pooh had a "thoughtful spot" where he would sit on a log, close one
eye, and tap his head repeatedly as he said, "Think, think, think."
In the spirit of Pooh, I named the blog "plou's tHoTFuL SPot".
</p>

<p>
There is something universally endearing about the characters who inhabit the
Hundred Acres Wood. Randy Pausch emphasized our conscious choice to be like
Eeyore or Tigger, to wallow in our sorrow or to approach life with a tenacious
joy. Benjamin Hoff related the Taoist idea of the uncarved block, "P'u", to the
character Pooh, attributing to Pooh a simple-minded, but not stupid, awareness
of the present moment. Of course, this blog is not about the world of
Winnie-the-Pooh, nor is it about anything specific really. But Pooh
and my other old friends from the Hundred Acres Wood remind me each and every
day to retain a childlike heart; I hope this blog is an outward expression of
a simple curiousity and joy.

        plan: replacing bike levers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 May 2017</span>

    <p>I’ve been pretty excited for a while to get a vintage
roadbike and I finally bought one in Seattle off Craigslist for $60 cash. I’ll
attach a photo sometime, but the bike is in fair condition with just a slight
bit of rust. The most enjoyable yet concerning features are the downtube shifters
and the fact that I can’t really grip/reach the break levers.</p>

<p>Downtube gear shifters are RETRO. Together with drinking Seattle cold brew, using downtube
shifters feels really hipster.
Unfortunately, these shifters are slightly less convenient because of where they are
located on the bike: down on the frame rather than where the hands sit on the
handlebars. I’m glad they work because I’m not sure it’s possible to bike
Seattle without multi-speed bikes…</p>

<p>The best part about this bike are its almost unreachable break levers. And
this would be totally okay if it weren’t for the Seattle streets. As I walked to
work the first day from Capitol Hill to Downtown, I discovered to my surprise that
Seattle has streets that
roll up and down. They are reminiscent of San Francisco’s to a
lesser degree. As someone trying to ride a vintage bike with downtube
shifters, it’s daunting enough to think about going uphill on varying inclines. But as someone
trying to ride a vintage bike with unreachable break levers, downhill sounds just
FANTASTIC. So here’s the upcoming weekend project. I spent about about $11 on a new set
of break cables and housing, and another $16 on break levers which arrive
tomorrow. I’m going to manually install responsive break levers. Photos to come.</p>
